## Introduction

Part of a learning course.

Done as a project and here are my notebooks of my contribution and exploration of methods like english translation using SynapseML.

Using Trial Fabric license to develop a Fabric solution including:
> Data Pipeline for orchestration \
> pySpark notebook for data processing & Cleaning \
> power BI fabric visualization
